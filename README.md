A high level library for playing music

## Requirements

### Rust

`music` targets the latest stable release of Rust.

### External Dependencies

`music` currently depends on two external non-Rust libraries, [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/) and
[SDL2_mixer](https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/).

- To install SDL2 and SDL2_mixer, follow the instructions on the 
[`rust-sdl2`](https://github.com/AngryLawyer/rust-sdl2#requirements) library README.
